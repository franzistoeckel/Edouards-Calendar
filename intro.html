					Unfortunately you already know the story behind. As always, I wasn’t able to shut my mouth (maybe I’ll learn one day, but it’s more likely that I’ll stay the same forever). <br>
					One day in my life I decided, that it’d be a good idea to write down some recipes for you. (or maybe it was you who basically forced me, but my version sounds a bit more romantic.)<br>
					Here they are, love! <br>
					Nevertheless, because I am me and I hate it when things are too easy, you’ll only get one once a day (amazing, this concept of advent calendars, isn’t it!). If you fancy it, you can have a guess based on the pictures I chose and the headings I gave my recipes. <br>
					I genuinely hope you’ll have loads of fun with this little present, since it coast me a few hours of my (luckily so far right now, not so valuable) time. I had plenty of fun writing them down and sometimes their surrounded by stories. The accompanying stories are sometimes pointless, sometimes connected to the recipe and very often related to the circumstances I was writing them in. If you read carefully you’ll be able to notice that I was angry a few times, annoyed, happy, overwhelmed, love-drunken or alcohol-drunken. I didn’t want to change any of this, because I think this very much represents me as a person. Too many feelings in a body to tiny for them and loads of difficulties to express them. You may be able to read my thought from my face expressions really easily but what I’m truly feeling is very often hidden behind a wall of silence. I am aware. There are so many insecurities in me, they won’t just disappear just because (and maybe that’s the first time ever.) someone (surprise: you are meant) truly loves me. It still overwhelms me. I have no idea where these insecurities come from, but there part of me. Nevertheless, having you by my side is truly amazing and every second just seems right. <br>
					Long story short: I love you. I love your personality, your mind, your intelligence, your appearance and last but not least your charisma and I hope you’ll enjoy reading this calendar as much as I enjoyed writing it.
