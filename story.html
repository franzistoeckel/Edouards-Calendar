					<p>Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there have been two people, a boy and a girl. The boy’s name was Edouard, the name of the girl was Franzi. <br>
						They didn’t live far away from each other in a country where they drink a potion, called Sterni, which makes them strong and brave. They even shared the same place to buy their beverages and supplies, and still they never met. <br>
						
						Lucky enough, one day, a crazy person called Amine, moved to this paradise of a city. Incidence had it, that he worked with another person, we’ll name him "Alessandro".<br>
						Alessandro is the famous bard of the city and was hoping to win the heart of a young lady, called Farina. Unfortunately, the bard was a bit naïve and overestimated his chances to win the young lady’s heart (or maybe it was luck for him, because Farina occasionally turns into a vampire…).<br>
						Anyway, Alessandro introduced the aspiring physicist Amine to Farina, who finally offered him to move in. (This is not the reality of what happened, but the reality was so mean and dark and hurtful, that it can’t be written down, after all this is a fairy-tale!). <br>
						You might now ask yourself what this story has to do with the website you are looking at. <br>
						One day, Amine needed help (another lie, he basically needs help every day!) and asked our hero Edouard as well as Franzi for help. And that’s how the two met and their love story begun. (Another lie, the first time we met I hardly even noticed you…) <br>
						
						Dear Ed, these sentences were only written down because of me loving to write and to make up random stories. They have nothing to do with the real purpose of this document, which is to conserve the stories we already shared. <br>
						I inserted every Whatsapp story of this summer, just to be able to recall them. <br>
						Have fun browsing through!
						</p>

						<p><strong>Day 1 “the start of an adventure”</strong></p>
						<p> What happened: we started the road trip after having one last falafel sandwich 
							Funniest moment: arriving in Münster and me being completely shocked about were you brought me. 
							What I’ll always remember:  Nina asking me tons of stuff about you, I haven’t even thought about. </p>

						<p><strong>Day 2 “the-should we ever have children-day”</strong></p>
						<p>	What happened: an adventure in a botanical garden, including screaming and loads of super cool plants. (I’m gonna drag you into every botanical garden from now on!). The only question which hasn’t been answered: who on earth came up with the idea of a spaghetti ice cream<br>	Memorable moment: me completely passing out after two puffs of weed <br>
							What I’ll always remember: the picture in my head of you trying to find a fitting condom </p>
