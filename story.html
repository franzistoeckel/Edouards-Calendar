					<h2 class="title title--full">Edouard and Franzi.</h2>
					<div class="meta meta--full">
					</div>

					<p>Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there have been two people, a boy and a girl. The boy’s name was Edouard, the name of the girl was Franzi. <br>
						They didn’t live far away from each other in a country where they drink a potion, called Sterni, which makes them strong and brave. They even shared the same place to buy their beverages and supplies, and still they never met. <br>
						
						Lucky enough, one day, a crazy person called Amine, moved to this paradise of a city. Incidence had it, that he worked with another person, we’ll name him "Alessandro".<br>
						Alessandro is the famous bard of the city and was hoping to win the heart of a young lady, called Farina. Unfortunately, the bard was a bit naïve and overestimated his chances to win the young lady’s heart (or maybe it was luck for him, because Farina occasionally turns into a vampire…).<br>
						Anyway, Alessandro introduced the aspiring physicist Amine to Farina, who finally offered him to move in. (This is not the reality of what happened, but the reality was so mean and dark and hurtful, that it can’t be written down, after all this is a fairy-tale!). <br>
						You might now ask yourself what this story has to do with the website you are looking at. <br>
						One day, Amine needed help (another lie, he basically needs help every day!) and asked our hero Edouard as well as Franzi for help. And that’s how the two met and their love story begun. (Another lie, the first time we met I hardly even noticed you…) <br>
						
						Dear Ed, these sentences were only written down because of me loving to write and to make up random stories. They have nothing to do with the real purpose of this document, which is to conserve the stories we already shared. <br>
						I inserted every Whatsapp story of this summer, just to be able to recall them. <br>
						Have fun browsing through!
						</p>

						<p><strong>Day 1 “the start of an adventure”</strong></p>
						<p> What happened: we started the road trip after having one last falafel sandwich 
							Funniest moment: arriving in Münster and me being completely shocked about were you brought me. 
							What I’ll always remember:  Nina asking me tons of stuff about you, I haven’t even thought about. </p>

						<p><strong>Day 2 “the-should we ever have children-day”</strong></p>
						<p>	What happened: an adventure in a botanical garden, including screaming and loads of super cool plants. (I’m gonna drag you into every botanical garden from now on!). The only question which hasn’t been answered: who on earth came up with the idea of a spaghetti ice cream<br>	Memorable moment: me completely passing out after two puffs of weed <br>
							What I’ll always remember: the picture in my head of you trying to find a fitting condom </p>
						<p><strong>Day 2.1</strong></p>
						<p>(because I have way more pictures than days to fill!) good morning, sunshine. I hope you had a pleasant flight.
							This days called „the breakfast“
							I can’t even remember how many amazing breakfasts I already shared with you, beginning with the very first one in Luwu, the brunch we had in fraeulein August when we intended to go bouldering and the many ones at our place. Definitely my favourite meal<br>
							To many more shared breakfasts in the future and many more shared views like this! Cheers! (Obviously with coffee!)
						</p>
						<p><strong>Day 3 "“can I please-please-please have a houseboat-day“</strong></p>
						<p>What happened: us arriving in rainy Amsterdam, being soaked after 10 minutes and having a delicious fondue and a small argument in the red light district. <br>
							Most memorable moment: probably the red light district and its surroundings. <br>
							What you probably forgot already: I still owe you a favour...!
							</p>
						<p><strong>Day 4 "the-maybe-(to me)-best day of the trip.“</strong></p>
						<p>Important note: I don’t wanna be mistaken. It was not the best day of the trip for me because of the things that happened in the bedroom, it was the best one because it was the day I realised that even under annoying circumstances we don’t annoy each other. <br> Why? I’m pretty sure you can easily get a bit depressed when hanging around with each other, seeing the rain 24/7 but we still managed to make it an unforgettable day. <br> It just doesn’t need much. A shitty movie. Olives. Some cheese. And even a leaking boot can’t destroy the mood. <br>
							That’s it for this day. It was completely unforgettable. The whole one. <br>
							</p>
							<p><strong>Day 5 “The future-hometown-day!” </strong></p>
							<p>Your soon to be hometown!<br> I know it doesn’t feel like it yet but I’m convinced you’re gonna make the best out of a city full of almost dead&retired people. Make it bloody yours! Tell them what you want and what you’re gonna do and you’re one step closer to the future Nobel prize. 🤓
								If i admire something about you it’s your possibility to focus on something so deeply you just get lost. I can’t remember to ever have this happen to me.
								Most memorable moment: being locked out of the car park maybe.<br>
								Least memorable moment: seeing you coming back and not looking as happy as I anticipated.<br>
								Anyways, I’m looking forward to spend many of my days in the future in lovely little delft!
								</p>
							<p><strong>Day 6 “the day of the beer“ </strong></p>
							<p>(luckily I’m not hangover anymore so I can write this without getting sick)<br>
								It’s a miracle that I even remember that day. I think it all started with the best breakfast in human history, a walk in a pretty but flooded with tourists city and led to day filled with beer!<br>
								Most memorable moment: I can’t name the highlight of the day for fuck sake! Breakfast-beers-waffles- all of them!
								</p>
							<p><strong>Day 7 “finally France!”</strong></p>
							<p>Most memorable moment: it gets a bit cheesy here. <br> As I told you yesterday whenever I feel alone I think about you hugging me. One of the best memories for that are the hours we spend together at the beach in Ostende. <br> I don’t even know why but they were special and bloody memorable. (Shivering right now). <br>
								And still there’s something which might even be equally memorable. It’s you and me being in this properly fancy and posh restaurant in Lille and your metamorphosis into this sophisticated guy speaking French and ordering wine... <br>
								You know what? I fancy every fucking side of you whether it’s the guy who drinks 10 funky Forelle while sitting on  the ground and talks bullshit or your posh french personality. <br>You’re just all in all a lovely human being. And I’m sorry I don’t give you the attention you deserve or want sometimes. You need to believe me that I truly like everything about you, not just the way you look like even more your intellect and intelligence and curiosity and (don’t get mad) your ability to complain about everything. It’s just not me to speak this out loud constantly. <br> I’m gonna try to make compliments more often but please don’t think something has changed because I don’t. I will always prefer to tease you because: qui s'aime bien se taquine. Sorry 
								</p>
							<p><strong>„The farewell“</strong></p>							
							<p>	Thanks for being there and going through a night meeting all my friends even though they weren’t really communicative. Thanks for making Alessandro buy Funky Fs! Thanks for looking amazing! Thanks for being by my side constantly! Thanks for telling me to slow down drinking. And thanks for not hesitating to kiss me in front of everyone. <br></p>
							<p><strong>“a summer by the lake(s)”</strong></p>
						<p>Soooo, I genuinely hope you’re not gonna wake up again because this is a message to read when waking up. I’ll call it “a summer by the lake(s)”
							Most memorable moments: definitely the one afternoon we spend at the Neustadt lake together. That was just plainly amazing. Having a Picknick with you, listening to music and making out in the lake was wonderful! <br> But I shouldn’t forget about all the other days spent by the lake. Whether we made fun of the retarded teenagers in the bay next to us or smoked some weed or talked about deep or not so deep stuff or again had just an amazing time kissing. Occasionally I wish I could provide pictures for all these hours but then I think these might be the moments I just have to keep in my memory and use them whenever I miss you tremendously or whenever life’s a bit rough.
							I have to admit that some of these days truly confused me because it they were truly breathtaking and I still didn’t really want to admit to myself that you might already had become more important to me than I wanted you to be. However, and that’s the conclusion: I’m more than glad we had these hours for ourselves and I won’t ever forget about them.</p>
							<br>
							<p><strong>"Once upon a time was the Best Date Ever! (So far - until the next one)"</strong></p>
							<p>This is about a day entitled: "Once upon a time was the Best Date Ever! (So far - until the next one)". <br> I too wished I had some pictures to illustrate, but none would properly translate the feelings of this day, and the many other special days I spent with you. <br>Perhaps the genuinely beautiful thought is that we were too busy enjoying the moment to have thought about capturing them with any other device but our minds. Now the story begins. It's obviously the one about the tryptic - Korean restaurant-Czech bar-LuWu 30 - which could have been so different, given that that evening both Ale and Amine were actually supposed to join (Yes, I checked!). <br> I guess I may have been frightened to spend a date alone with you (no, not really). In the end, the stars aligned for us on that night. As they had for the whole Summer basically. I can't recall the last time I laughed so much! The food was great, the gin-based cocktails were as well, but the company was simply amazing! I'm pretty sure we had one more G&T, or two, when arriving at your place, before letting the evening drift into the night. <br> I immediately knew it was the best date I ever had. I also knew that I would never have to worry about feeling bored or awkward when with you. We have already had some dates at the Peissnitz which had started at 3pm and lasted until the next morning, so there was not much doubt in my mind already. I now cannot wait to have many more dates with you, fancy or not, both in Notts and Delft, and in plenty of other places!</p>
							<p><strong>Day 8 “The I want to go on holidays with you for the rest of my life”</strong></p>
							<p>Dear Edouard,<br>
							<p>I’ll never change the story I was going to write because that would just be a stupid childish reaction. Just because things are difficult sometimes doesn’t mean that my feelings for you will change in a split second. But, and that’s something which is undeniable, we have to address a few things once we’re back together. I am convinced that nothing of it is impossible to solve and the last thing I want is that anything is going to change between us.
								However, here’s my story. As you might already anticipated it is about the last ever day on our tiny but amazing road trip, the last 24 hours we spent together.
								“The I want to go on holidays with you for the rest of my life” <br>
								I think (correct me if I’m wrong) the day started with a hunt for the best croissants in whole Lille. Funny enough, you could’ve bought every random croissant in Lille I would’ve loved it. Who cares whether the croissant is amazing when the company isn’t? Or- in our case-the other way round!
								Most memorable moment: definitely the hours we spent at the beach in Dunkerque. Having a few last hours of summer was the perfect ending of the best summer ever. I just wished it would’ve been our very personal beach without any other person around. With food and being alone I’m almost sure we’d still be there <br>
								Least memorable moment: if any than me trying to do a bloody cartwheel. <br>
								But, and that’s something I love about the two of us who cares at the end whether I’m able to do a cartwheel? Who cares whether we’re the only grown ups fooling around like teenagers at the beach? I definitely don’t. <br> And I love that being around you most of the time also means, that I’ll forget all the sorrows and worries I have and we can just be careless and feel reckless (at least that’s what I feel)
								Same happened in the tiny living room restaurant, where we again just fooled around like love drunken teenagers, and I bloody didn’t mind. <br>Being around you means being happy and free and I don’t want anything in this world to change this.
								Sorry for the probably second longest message in WhatsApp history and i finally I wish you a bearable rest of the journey.<br> I can’t wait to kiss you, handsome!
