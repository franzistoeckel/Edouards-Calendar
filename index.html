					<p>I admit this is very, very weird, almost ludicrous.</p><br>
					<p> I always wished to get this dish. All the fucking time! Still, it’s one of my go to dishes if I don’t know
						what to eat and I made it for Amine once and he didn’t hate it. Which at the end let me to include it into this
						list of mostly a bit more exiting and interesting recipes.</p><br>
					<p><strong>You need:</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>potatoes</li>
						<li>quark (I am not sure, whether you can get this particular product in the Netherlands, I found it in the UK
							once, so there is a slight chance)</li>
						<li>milk</li>
						<li>butter</li>
						<li>fresh herbs (parsley, chives, dill, sorrel, cress,…) </li>
						<li>salt, pepper, caraway, paprika</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>To do:</strong></p>
					<ol>
						<li>Boil the potatoes (after peeling them or boil them with the peel and peel them afterwards)</li>
						<li>Mix everything else together (except for the butter) until it tastes nice and has a thick but not too thick
							consistency </li>
						<li>Serve... </li>
						<li>….put loads of butter on top of the steaming potatoes!</li>
					</ol>
					<p>I’m a bit embarrassed this is actually considered a dish….</p>

					<p>I don’t know whether this should actually qualify as a recipe, considering that it just contains everything I
						was able to find in the fridges of LuWu</p><br>
					<p>Perhaps it doesn’t even taste that nice if half the ingredients are not already above the date they should be
						eaten by. Anyhow, I’ll type it down for you, to make you decide yourself. It’s definitely nice to take it to
						work. </p><br>
					<p>(And yes, I am fucking aware by now that COUSCOUS is actually the dish and that Germans are retarded, but that
						won’t change me using the “wrong” word.)</p><br>
					<p><strong>You need:</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Couscous</li>
						<li>every leftover from the fridge you can find, this includes:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>tomatoes</li>
							<li>cucumber</li>

					</ul>
					<p><strong>To do:</strong></p>
					<ol>
						<li>Surprise! Boil the couscous</li>
						<li>Cut everything else in cubes</li>
						<li>If I use mushrooms I usually fry them first</li>
						<li>Mix!</li>
						<li>Add some olive oil or the oil the tomatoes were in</li>
						<li>If you have, add the juice of half a lemon and a bit of honey</li>
						<li>Add spices: cumin, pepper. Salt, paprika, cardamom, cilantro,…</li>
						<li>Serve (if you found it in your fridge) with yoghurt and mint</li>

					<p>Joris read this title and asked me what its supposed to mean. So apparently I am the only one realising that
						it is not spring right now… Anyhow, this dish contains asparagus and I’m a big supporter of SPARGELZEIT. I know
						that nowadays asparagus is available the whole year round but I’m fine with only being able to buy it one month
						per year. During this time, I’d probably make this dish 10 times. It’s easy, quickly prepared and get be eaten
						warm and cold which makes it perfect for work!</p>
					<p>Enough said, here it comes:</p>
					<p>(Funny enough, this should’ve been the end of the story, but the following happened while I was writing the
						recipe: I am sitting at the airport in Birmingham right now and sent you a picture of my Espresso Martini with my
						(what I thought) fully censored screen. Andddd…. I screwed up. I am the worst in keeping secrets, and I am very
						sorry I said “Fuck you for spying”, I just got frightened I destroyed the surprise.)</p>
					<p>So, finally, here is the recipe:</p>
					<p><strong>You need:</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Green asparagus</li>
						<li>pasta (this time short pasta, even though I hate it)</li>
						<li>lemon</li>
						<li>A nice bunch of arugula</li>
						<li>cheese</li>
						<li>onions</li>
						<li>S+p</li>
						<li>Balsamic vinegar, olive oil</li>
						<li>parsley</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>To do:</strong></p>
					<ol>
						<li>Cut the woody ends of the asparagus and cut the rest into 2-3 cm long pieces</li>
						<li>Heat a pan with olive oil and fry the asparagus for somewhat 5-10 minutes (it mostly depends on how you like
							it, I prefer the asparagus to still be crunchy)</li>
						<li>boil the pasta al dente</li>
						<li>Cut feta cheese in cubes, do the same with spring onions and parsley</li>
						<li>When the asparagus is done, deglaze it with a few tablespoons of balsamic vinegar, add as much honey as you
							want, depending on how much vinegar you added, it should be a balanced taste of sweet and sour</li>
						<li>Wash the arugula and tear it into halves</li>
						<li>Mix everything together in a bowl and season with lemon juice, salt and pepper (add some extra olive oil when
							to dry, additionally you can also add the lemon zest</li>
						<li>ENJOY</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Song to listen to: The kinks- I’m not like everybody else (Sorry again, that having me as a girlfriend is such
						a hassle sometimes!)</p>
					<p>To drink: Espresso Martini maybe? (I love you!) (You, not the drink!!!!)</p>

					<p><strong>THIS IS MY BIRTHDAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</strong></p>
					<p>That much I know, now I wonder what to write down. Maybe that I wish I’d have a birthday party like yours in
						summer? It’s a bit embarrassing but it was always my dream to have my birthday in summer. Since I can remember I
						just wanted to celebrate my birthday with a BBQ being surrounded by friends. However, last year I finally
						celebrated my birthday in summer but without anyone around me who’s important to me. Don’t get me wrong, I did
						have an amazing time but something was missing. Maybe, I should make it my personal goal to be rich enough at the
						age of thirty to celebrate in a country having summer in December and to be able to buy a flight for all of my
						friends. (Life goal from now on!)</p><br>
					<p>Nevertheless, I still don’t know which recipe to write down. Today is the 20th October 2018, you booked your
						flight for Nottingham yesterday while being in New Caledonia and I am sitting here on a Saturday evening typing.
						Every day was easy to write so far but I feel like this one has to be special. (“under pressure ” is being sung
						in my head right now) There have been a couple of birthdays in my life which I strongly remember. My 17th
						birthday, which I celebrated with a friend and it totally escalated. Police had to come, people were injured and
						the whole venue massively destroyed. After that I didn’t celebrate any until I turned 21. </p><br>
					<p>And this year? I am tuning 26 in 1 ½ months. 4 years away from being 30. How is being 30? Do things change? Are
						there goals I want to reach until I am 30? Is there something I always wanted to have done by the age of 26?
						There are a few things I am certain about right now. You are the person I want to grow old with. I can’t wait to
						move into a flat together with you, come home after a day of work and just chat with you, have dinner together
						and do whatever we want to do. Until now, I was never able to imagine that one day I would feel comfortable with
						the idea of settling with someone. I thought, that nothing ever will be as important to me as keeping the freedom
						I have, but you’ve changed my perception. Growing old always frightened me somehow, and it definitely still does,
						but the idea of aging together with you sounds not even that bad. To conclude this whole, trivial monologue: I
						hope we are going to celebrate loads of birthdays together. </p><br>
					<p>And finally, you’re going to get a recipe. This is a particular weird one, because it contains meat. BUT it is
						chicken and the stupid me hopes that one day we are going to have 5 hens together. </p><br>
					<p><strong>You need:</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>one whole chicken</li>
						<li>soup vegetables – carrots, celery, leek, onion </li>
						<li>flour</li>
						<li>peas</li>
						<li>asparagus (if it’s the season)</li>
						<li>juice of a lemon</li>
						<li>parsley</li>
						<li>s+p</li>
					</ul>

					<p><strong>To do:</strong></p>
					<ol>
						<li>Fry an onion in a bit of oil, add carrot, leek and celery</li>
						<li>Put chicken into the pot and cover with water</li>
						<li>Boil the chicken until tender (the whole thing!), takes at least 60 minutes</li>
						<li>Take chicken out and let cool for a bit, safe the broth!</li>
						<li>Cut chicken in tiny pieces (it should be so tender it almost falls apart)</li>
						<li>Heat butter in a huge pot, add some flour and stir, let thicken</li>
						<li>Add broth until you got an soup-like consistency</li>
						<li>Add another 2-3 carrots, peas and asparagus</li>
						<li>Boil rice in separate pot</li>
						<li>Boil vegetables until almost done</li>
						<li>Add chicken, add lemon juice, season with salt and pepper</li>
						<li>Serve with rice in a deep plate and sprinkle some parsley on top</li>

					<p>Definitely one of my favourite dishes! Traditionally eaten in south Germany and Austria or while skiing. I took the challenge and made them myself and it turned out great. So here’s the recipe. </p>
					<p><strong>You need:</strong></p>
					<ul>
					<li>300g spinach</li>
								<li>2 eggs</li>
								<li>200g old bread (preferably old Brötchen or toast</li>
								<li>120ml milk</li>
								<li>1 onion</li>
								<li>1 clove of garlic</li>
								<li>butter</li>
								<li>flour</li>
								<li>s+p</li>
								<li>nutmeg</li>
								<li>any cheese you like (some gratable, strong cheese works best. Pecorino for example.)</li>
							</ul>
							<p><strong>To do:</strong></p>
							<ol>
								<li>Either defrost spinach in pan or blanche fresh spinach for a few minutes</li>
								<li>Cut in really, really tiny pieces (a blender works really well, a knife does the job as well)</li>
								<li>Mix with the eggs</li>
								<li>Cut bread in roughly 1 centimetre pieces, cut onion and garlic in cubes</li>
								<li>Fry garlic and onion in butter</li>
								<li>Mix spinach, bread, garlic, onion, spices and milk</li>
								<li>Let sit for 30 mins</li>
								<li>Boil water in BIG pot</li>
								<li>Form dumplings out of dough (please check consistency, if you feel like it’s still too soft, add as much flour as needed)</li>
								<li>Boil in water until the dumplings flood</li>
								<li>Pour some melted butter above and add some grated cheese</li>
								</ol>
								<p>Song to listen to: Wanda-Columbo</p>
							<p>Drink: Bombardino, the traditional after skiing drink (please only if you don’t need to work or drive anymore, because this is warm eggnog + rum + whipped cream…)</p>

					<p>Unfortunately this is the last day of your very personal advent calendar, I hope you enjoyed the past 24 days!</p><br>
					<p>Obviously the last day somehow has to be special. To me there is only one last possibility left to top
						everything else I wrote before.</p>
					<p>Possibly, you are opening this advent calendar door right now, while lying next to me in my bed in Nottingham.
						In a few hours we will have to board a plane to celebrate Christmas together in Germany. If there is something I
						am very certain about than that this Christmas will be one of the most special one’s ever. I’m glad that we’ll
						be
						able to spend time together and also its exciting that we’ll see three countries together within just a few
						days.
						I genuinely like the way our life’s going right now. This story is being written while sitting in a plane, on
						the
						way from Amsterdam back to Birmingham. I forgot my keys at yours. I assume that’s what’s going to happen quite
						often within the next few years. I’ll forget stuff, I’ll miss trains, busses and (hopefully not) planes. I’ll
						spend senseless amounts of money and time, I’ll have to learn how to study in public transport and I should
						download more music on Spotify. This weekend was the first real trial (at least to me) how having a long
						distance
						relationship will be.</p>
					<p>You can believe me, that I was genuinely concerned on my way here (I believe that’s even noticeable in the
						calendar entry of the 20th December). Will all this hassle be worth it? Will the feeling be the same? Has
						something changed? </p> <br>
					<p>After spending the last weekend together with you I can confidently say that it definitely is. I enjoyed every
						second and moment, and I won’t doubt a single second to do it again and again and again. (Except for forgetting
						my keys possibly…)</p><br>
					<p>It is a bit sad that this is the last calendar entry ever, I liked writing down my thoughts and connecting
						them
						with some recipes. I hope you had as much fun reading as I had writing, and maybe I’ll find another medium to
						express myself in the future. We’ll see. Nevertheless, I still owe you a recipe, right? Or maybe I don’t. I can
						imagine that you already have an idea of what’s coming, since I asked you for a few hours of your time. This
						time
						it won’t be you having to cook, this time you are officially invited to a three course menu made by me. The
						decision about when this will happen is entirely on you, just give me a few days’ notice please!</p><br>
					<p><strong>ENJOY &amp; MERRY CHRISTMAS!</strong></p>

					<p>Another dish we ate together (even though I think I made this particular one without coconut milk) on one of
						the many amazing evenings we spent at your place. The next day I took the leftovers to work, driving bra-less on
						my bike balancing the leaking soup in one hand and trying to control my bike with the other one. Shit, I deeply
						miss driving this road with my bicycle and I almost miss the occasional walk of shame (or pride) from yours to
						mine.</p><br>
					<p><Strong>You need:</Strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>a pumpkin (buy Hokkaido, you can use these one without the need to peal it)</li>

						<li>broth</li>
						<li>1 onion</li>
						<li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
						<li>a couple of carrots</li>
						<li>1 lemon</li>
						<li>1-2 slices of real bread</li>
						<li>butter</li>
						<li>Spices: s+p, paprika, cumin, ginger, nutmeg, chili, 1 pinch of cinnamon, thyme (fresh or dried)</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>To do:</strong></p>
					<ol>
						<li>Cut Hokkaido, carrots, onion and garlic, grate ginger</li>
						<li>Fry onion and add garlic and ginger shortly after, let roast for a bit, dredge paprika on top and let it fry
							for a few seconds</li>
						<li>Add now the pumpkin and the carrots</li>
						<li>Add broth until vegetables are covered and let simmer for 20 minutes</li>
						<li>Add coconut milk and lemon juice and blend</li>
						<li>Heat a pan, melt butter add thyme</li>
						<li>Put the bread (which is cut in cubes) into the butter and let fry for a bit</li>
						<li>Flavour the soup with everything which is mentioned above (if something else comes into your mind, feel free
							to do so)</li>
						<li>Serve soup with bread on top</li>
						<li>ENJOY!</li>
					</ol>

					<p>Song to listen to: Lea – Louise Attaque (just because it is a French song and I am very sure we were listening

					<p>As you might have recognised every dish so far was supposed to be eaten for lunch or dinner and as far as I’m

						ARE
						THE KING OF BREAKFAST!
						What am I supposed to write down, when talking to the master of brunch? The emperor of scrambled eggs? The true

					<p>The dish itself looks a bit time consuming in the beginning, but every part is more than worth its time. The
						hummus is not comparable with the shitty, preservative containing one you get in the supermarkets and every
						piece
						can be stored for a few days in the fridge, so it's time well wasted.</p>
					<p><strong>You need:</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>chick peas</li>
						<li>tahini</li>
						<li>garlic</li>
						<li>lemons</li>

					</ul>
					<p><strong>To do:</strong></p>

					<ol>
						<li>Hummus: </li>
						<ol>
							<li>Blend together: chick peas, 2-3 teaspoons tahini, as much garlic as you want, juice of half a lemon, the
								water the chick peas were soaked in until it has a smooth consistency and add a splash of olive oil to make it
								a bit more creamy</li>
							<li>Flavour with loads of salt, pepper and cumin (it really needs loads of spices)</li>
						</ol>
						<li>Baba Ghanoush:</li>
						<ol>
							<li>Preheat oven to 200-220 degree Celsius</li>
							<li>Cut eggplant in half and poke holes into peel</li>
							<li>Pour a bit of olive oil on a baking tray and put eggplant on the tray (with cut half towards the tray)</li>
							<li>Bake for roughly 45 minutes until soft</li>
							<li>Pull pulp out with a spoon</li>
							<li>Again: mix with tahini, olive oil, cumin and lemon juice</li>
							<li>Season with s+p and spread some cut parsley on top</li>
						</ol>
						<li>Pea “hummus”</li>
						<ol>
							<li>Put frozen peas in a bowl and cover with boiling water</li>
							<li>Let sit for a couple of minutes until defrosted</li>

						</ol>
						<li>Flat bread</li>
						<ol>
							<li>Dissolve yeast with sugar in LUKEWARM water</li>
							<li>Add flour and mix well</li>
							<li>Finally add yoghurt, salt and oil until you got a smooth yeast dough</li>
							<li>Let rest for at least an hour in a WARM but not HOT spot! (no draft!!!!!)</li>
							<li>Take out, put dough onto a baking tray and form into something wich looks roughly like a flat bread </li>
							<li>Cover and let rest for another 20 minutes</li>
							<li>Poke dents into the dough </li>
							<li>Mix milk and oil and spread on the dough </li>
							<li>Sprinkle sesame seeds and black cumin seed on top </li>
							<li>Bake for 20 minutes in 200 degree Celsius oven</li>
							<li>Enjoy!</li>

					<p>P.S. To make it a perfect evening, serve together with some olives, sarma, cubed feta cheese, artichoke

					<p>Again, a dish we already shared! Another day in lovely LuWu, you coming to ours having the worst mood ever,
						after not eating throughout the whole day, if I remember correctly. We had a couple of glasses of wine before we
						even started dinner. And when I finally put the lasagne on the table it was gone within minutes, eaten by you,
						Amine and Tim. Stupid me, intending to make it last for at least 2 days…</p><br>
					<p>Anyway, I think it’s a delicious dish but it takes a lot of time but it’s definitely worth it!</p>
					<p><strong>You need:</strong></p>

					<ul>
						<li>tiny pieces of soy</li>
						<li>chopped tomatoes</li>
						<li>tomato paste</li>
						<li>carrots (2)</li>
						<li>celery (not a whole one, maybe a quarter)</li>
						<li> 1 or 2 onions</li>
						<li>garlic</li>
						<li>lasagne plates</li>
						<li> flour</li>
						<li>milk</li>
						<li>butter</li>
						<li>cheese (mozzarella and gouda)</li>
						<li>nutmeg</li>
						<li>red wine</li>
						<li>Spices:s+p, bay leafs, thyme, basil, parsley, oregano</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>To do:</strong></p>

					<ol>
						<li>Fry onions and garlic until golden, soak soy in broth (I have a hard time to estimate how much… it depends
							on
							how big your baking tray is, maybe like 100g per person)</li>
						<li>Add a solid amount of tomato paste and fry for a bit, add soaked and well drained soy and fry a bit more</li>
						<li>Grate celery and carrots and put them into the pan too</li>
						<li>Deglaze with red wine</li>
						<li>Pour in one or two cans of chopped tomatoes and add loads of herbs (basically whatever you like!)</li>
						<li>Let boil for a while (the longer the better, sometimes I already prepare it in the afternoon and let it
							simmer until I need the sauce)</li>
						<li>Prepare béchamel sauce shortly before you need it</li>
						<li>Melt butter in pot and add some flour</li>
						<li>Whisk very, very well you don’t want it to get lumpy</li>
						<li>Pour milk in, slowly, while constantly whisking until it has a thick but pourable consistency</li>
						<li>Flavour with nutmeg, s+p, paprika, thyme,…</li>
						<li>Preheat oven</li>
						<li>Pour some tomato sauce into a baking tray</li>
						<li>Cover with lasagne plates, add tomato sauce again, cover with béchamel sauce</li>
						<li>Obviously do this as long as you run out supply</li>
						<li>For extra cheese add one layer of mozzarella somewhere in between</li>
						<li>End with loads of cheese!!!!!</li>
						<li>Bake until golden brown (45 minutes maybe)</li>

					<p>Today is the 28th of November. This shouldn’t be important at all but somehow I feel like this day and its
						story is going to be even weirder than everything else so far. Today is such a weird day. I genuinely have no
						clue what is happening to me. It’s the day of the morning when my bike wasn’t drivable (in case you are
						wondering
						where to put this story within a certain timeframe). I would love to call you right now, but whenever I pick up
						my phone to do so, I’m not brave enough (what one earth is going on with me?!). I feel so terribly alone in this
						country today, totally misplaced and out of my element. The whole day I am considering to walk the 20m to the
						office of my supervisor and quit (what the fuck am I thinking?!). This has always been my dream, no? I wanted
						prove myself that I am able to handle a topic for longer than a few days, I wanted to educate myself, wanted to
						make a difference in this dark, dark world. However, now it feels as if everything around me is just dark (one
						of
						the reasons might be, that I haven’t seen the sunlight for at least two weeks). I think everyone is having these
						moments of melancholia every now and then and I shouldn’t be ashamed that I do as well, but I hate to make
						myself
						look weak and fearful. I know that I’ll be able to finish this PhD, probably it won’t be the worst thesis ever
						and still I have a constant feeling of doing the wrong thing. Funny enough, that’s what happens to me all the
						time. It started with me being a stupid Au Pair in Spain (which I knew was a retarded idea but did it anyway,
						because of the lack of other options), studying pharmacy (which I never really enjoyed, but kind of grew into)
						and beginning a PhD (because, let’s be honest I didn’t know what else to do in my life). This is not supposed to
						sound sad, I don’t regret any of these decisions, I’ve learned from all of them and I am glad for every
						experience I got because it made me who I am. Not being afraid of new things, being able to cope with losing and
						having an open mind (at least that’s what I think I am, correct me if I’m wrong!). I would probably do all of
						this again, whether it’s because of (still) no other options or boredom. So how do you fit into this picture,
						you
						might wonder? Easy answer: For the first time ever in my life I feel like I have arrived where I am supposed to
						be. I don’t feel the need any more to try as much as possible (and yes, even if you don’t want to hear it, guys
						included). I am afraid to type this because it makes me an easy target and vulnerable, but for the first time
						ever I can see myself settling somewhere and being happy with not erratically changing decisions, friends and
						guys any more. (I know this might bother you, but it is part of my life, and I think you do understand the
						context this is written in). None of this means, I will lose my curious mind or my urge to discover new places,
						food and people. It just means that my mind has found a save spot, a place where I can rest, be myself and let
						down the guard.
						I don’t know what overcame me to write all this for the 16t of December calendar entry, but as mentioned above,
						it was a weird day. I genuinely hope you won’t judge me for any of the words which have been written, and you
						don’t consider me as being too cheesy, weird or crazy. I’ll stop here and you’ll get a recipe. Promise. I love
						you!
					</p>

					<p><strong>You need:</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Burger buns (of course you can also make them yourself, but I am too lazy right now to copy a recipe from
							the
							internet)</li>
						<li>A can of kidney beans</li>
						<li>Onions (a solid couple) </li>
						<li>Salad of your choice</li>
						<li>1 avocado</li>
						<li>1-2 tomatoes</li>
						<li>Lemon juice</li>
						<li>Oats</li>
						<li>Garlic</li>
						<li>Marjoram</li>
						<li>S+p</li>
						<li>Sugar</li>
						<li>Balsamic vinegar</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>To do:</strong></p>

					<ol>
						<li>Drain the beans very, very well!</li>
						<li>Put them I a bowl and add 2-3 tablespoons of oats, s+p and marjoram, mix well with your hand (the beans are
							supposed to get smashed!) and let sit for a bit </li>
						<li>Make a guacamole (I think you know how to.)</li>
						<li>Heat a pan to very high heat</li>
						<li>Form patties out of the bean mixture (it should be dry but not crumbly, if you are not sure whether they
							have
							the right consistency, sacrifice one)</li>
						<li>Fry two-3 minutes from each side, maybe longer (but take care, they burn super-fast!)</li>
						<li>Cut onions in rings (you’ll need at least 4-5)</li>
						<li>Fry them in in a pan with oil for a few minutes (they don’t need to get dark)</li>
						<li>Add a couple of teaspoons of sugar and let caramelise</li>
						<li>Deglaze with balsamic vinegar and let simmer until all the liquid is gone</li>
						<li>Toast burger buns and arrange your burger the way you want it to be</li>
						<li>ENJOY!</li>

					</ol>
					<p>Drink: beer (after writing this text I'll surely need one later.</p>

					<p>First recipe with a weird story is coming! I made this dish the first time with Dracula in LuWu, possibly in
						summer ’17. Karl was there as well, while preparing we got properly high. We still went on cooking but until now
						I can’t tell whether what we ate was really delicious or whether we just hallucinated. However, we made it
						again,
						it is definitely a decent dish, easily to prepare and it’s going to have left overs which are perfect to take to
						work! </p>
					<p><strong>You need:</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>As many courgettes as you want. For this purpose I am going to say 2</li>
						<li>A handful of tomatoes</li>
						<li>tiny pieces of soy (which are going to replace the minced meat) –roughly 100g</li>
						<li>couscous (as much as you consider enough)</li>
						<li>fresh mint</li>
						<li>yoghurt</li>
						<li> tomato puree</li>
						<li>1 onion</li>
						<li>1 clove of garlic</li>
						<li>cream cheese</li>
						<li>cheese! (Feta is nice, Gouda works, again, whatever you like!)</li>
						<li>one can of cubed tomatoes</li>
						<li>Spices: S+P, paprika, chili, broth, cumin, turmeric</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>To do:</strong></p>

					<ol>
						<li>Soak soy in broth (~15 min)</li>
						<li>Cut onion and garlic, set aside</li>
						<li>Cut courgette (s) in half, take out the inner part (to have a whole in the middle)</li>
						<li>Don’t throw the inner parts of courgette, set aside as well!</li>
						<li>Drain the soy and squeeze it as much as possible, it has to be as dry as possible</li>
						<li>Heat pan, fry garlic and onions, add 2-3 table spoons of tomato puree</li>
						<li>Pre-heat oven</li>
						<li>Add soy to pan, fry really, really well (almost burnt, otherwise it is not going to have any taste!)</li>
						<li>Add inner parts of courgette (which you cut in pieces)</li>
						<li>Add s+p, paprika and if wanted chili</li>
						<li>Add tomatoes (which you might have to cut in cubes, depending on the tomatoes you bought)</li>
						<li>Add 2-3 table spoons of cream cheese to make the mixture a bit more liquid</li>
						<li>Fill courgette with mixture, add s+p and a pinch of sugar to cubed, canned tomatoes</li>
						<li>Take a baking tray, fill with tomatoes, set courgettes on top</li>
						<li>Cover courgettes with cheese of choice and place in the oven</li>
						<li>Prepare couscous (how, should be clear, if not look at packaging)</li>
						<li>Add some olive oil and salt to couscous (also I like to add cumin and turmeric)</li>
						<li>Cut mint leaves in pieces, add to yoghurt, add s+p</li>
						<li>Bake courgette 15-20 min</li>
						<li>Serve everything together nd enjoy!</li>

					<p>Like a few recipes already this is one having a story!<br>
						Once upon a time I had the key to your flat. One lovely evening I just couldn’t be bothered to be in my flat
						anymore, I took my TOEFL book (it’s insane but I remember almost every minute of this evening as if it was
						yesterday!) and decided to go to yours. I stole basic foods from LuWu, met Nina and Tim while doing so and they
						just smiled at me, exactly knowing where I’m going. Anyway, I went to EDEKA (probably the third time this day)
						and bought everything for what I intended to cook. (This is most likely going to be a super boring story, I have
						no idea why I remember every single detail). After arriving at your I figured that I forgot half the stuff I was
						supposed to buy and had to go back to my third favourite place in Halle (btw, there’s an amazing saying in
						german, which I’m just going to literally translate: “What’s not in your head, you’ll have to have in your
						legs!”). Nevertheless, I made it back to Rathenauplatz eventully, starting to cook.
						I am pretty sure you came back from the gym and I just enjoyed cooking for myself in a spacious kitchen
						massively! So far there is no outcome to this story and I’m not 100% convinced there will ever be one but after
						all we had an amazing evening (don’t know whether I still have to stretch this, because I don’t remember a
						single
						evening which was not amazing) and I’d say we ate a decent meal.
						After all this pointless sentences I am not entirely sure whether you still want the recipe, but here it is:</p>
					<p><strong>You need:</strong></p>

					<ul>
						<li>Onions (has there be a recipe without so far? I might have a serious problem, if you want you’re allowed to
							call me the onion knight from now on!)</li>
						<li>garlic</li>
						<li>risotto rice</li>
						<li>white wine</li>
						<li> mushrooms (a variance if possible)</li>
						<li>a lemon</li>
						<li>thyme</li>
						<li>spring onions</li>
						<li>parmesan</li>
						<li>butter</li>
						<li>broth (btw, that’s why I had to go back to EDEKA)</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>To do:</strong></p>
					<ol>
						<li>Fry onions and a bit later garlic in butter</li>
						<li>Add the amount of rice you want and let fry for a bit</li>
						<li>Prepare broth, meaning boil water and add the instant powder and keep warm</li>
						<li>Deglaze with white wine and let fully evaporate</li>
						<li>Add one dipper of broth at the time, always letting evaporate the last one completely</li>
						<li>Fry mushrooms in separate pan (as few as possible with no oil or butter!)</li>
						<li>Cut spring onions and put into the rice</li>
						<li>Rice needs roughly 30 minutes, you want it to be ‘al dente’</li>
						<li>Take pot down from the stove, add mushrooms, a decent amount of butter and cheese</li>
						<li>Spice up! (Needs a lot, freshly grounded pepper, thyme, salt, lemon juice,…)</li>
						<li>Enjoy!</li>

					<p>I am not 100% sure whether or not you remember this particular night. I am also not completely certain about
						all the circumstances but I’ll try to put the puzzle back together. I think you and Amine went bouldering. I’ve
						definitely been home for longer already and I made the salad I am talking about. Anyway, you came to ours and we
						were supposed to meet Amine outside to have another beer. Unfortunately we got distracted, which led to the poor
						guy having to wait outside and us having fun in my room. And, even worse, us coming outside a couple of minutes
						later looking completely destroyed and smelling like sex. But, and that’s the important part of the story, I’d
						do
						it over and over again, since I am very sure that the passion we share is not going to fade any time. <br>
						Long story short: here is the recipe. </p>

					<p><strong>You need:</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Brown lentils (1 cup, maybe)</li>
						<li> ½ cucumber</li>
						<li>tomatoes</li>
						<li>feta cheese (or sometimes I use smoked tofu)</li>
						<li>carrot</li>
						<li>spring onions (~2)</li>
						<li>sundried tomatoes</li>
						<li>1 avocado</li>
						<li> balsamic acid</li>
						<li>honey</li>
						<li>mustard</li>
						<li>olive oil</li>
						<li>s+p</li>
						<li>paprika</li>
					</ul>

					<p><strong>To do:</strong></p>
					<p>This is probably the easiest recipe you’re going to get and I’m even a bit embarrassed to write it down.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Boil lentils according to instruction</li>
						<li>Cut everything else in cubes</li>
						<li>Take a jar (which can be closed), mix olive oil, vinegar, honey and mustard and shake</li>
						<li>Mix everything in a bowl and season</li>

					<p>As much as I loved Rathenauplatz not having an oven was definitely a downfall. However, now you finally have
						one (even a fancy one, and actually even two) so let’s use them! Also, you’ve eaten this before! I am not sure
						whether you remember, but one day in our life in the summer of 2018 you came to LuWu (if anyone else not
						involved will ever read these recipes, they might think I am making this up, but you’ve literally been there
						every single day) while Farina and I were having early German dinner. It has always been our go-to-dish if we
						don’t know what to eat other wise and I am convinced that this is the perfect dish for weekdays. <br> Here is
						comes: </p>
					<p>
						<stong>You need:</stong>
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Potatoes (either the normal ones or sweet potatoes or both)</li>
						<li>Beet root (If you want to)</li>
						<li>Carrots</li>

						<li>Sour cream</li>

						<li>Spices: s+p, chilli</li>
						<li>Olive oil</li>
					</ul>

					<p><strong>To do:</strong></p>
					<ol>
						<li>Cut vegetables in equally sized cubes </li>
						<li>Put them in a big bowl and add a couple of tablespoons of olive oil and loads of spices and dry herbs (thyme
							and rosemary mostly)</li>
						<li>Mix thoroughly</li>
						<li>Preheat oven and bake veggies for roughly 45 minutes</li>
						<li>While waiting prepare a guacamole and mix sour cream with whatever spices and herbs you like</li>
